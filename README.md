# Projects-CSS-HTML
My projects using css and html
building a survey form was the first project i did with html. It has many flaws. The 2nd one was a tribute page to Srk.
Technical documentation page is my third project. Product landing page is my fourth. My 5th is the Portfolio.
Between these I've also done css projects like Buildings, ferris wheel and piano. These are done with help and guidance from freecodecamp.
